# While this text can be viewed as PDF, it is most useful to have a Jupyter environment. I have an environment ready for each of you, but you can get your own local environment going in several ways. One popular way is with Anaconda (<a href="https://www.anaconda.com/">https://www.anaconda.com/</a>. Because of the limited time, you can use my server.

# ## NoSQL
# > NoSQL databases (aka "not only SQL") are non tabular, and store data differently than relational tables. NoSQL databases come in a variety of types based on their data model. The main types are document, key-value, wide-column, and graph. They provide flexible schemas and scale easily with large amounts of data and high user loads.

# ### What is partition tolerance?
# > A partition is a communications break within a distributed systemâ€”a lost or temporarily delayed connection between two nodes. Partition tolerance means that the cluster must continue to work despite any number of communication breakdowns between nodes in the system.
